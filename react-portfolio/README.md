# React Portfolio

A responsive react portfolio showcasing a few of my projects, with links to my github, and linked portfolio, as well as my CV.

## User Journey

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer

WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio

WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted

WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted

WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default

WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them

WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories

WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message

WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required

WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address

WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies

WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
```

## Challenges

Understanding how the components would work, and working with a new framework, and syntax.

## Future development

For this project I wanted to learn the basics of React. So I reconstructured my previous portfolio to work in a React App. In teh near future I would like to create a better user interface for my portfolio, and make it more interactive. I am currently just using CSS for styling. I would like to use other styling framework such as Chakra UI to have the website looking better.

## Technology used

I used the following technologies in the app:

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** - For the frontend of the app. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
